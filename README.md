# 🧠 Mind Mesh: AI-Based Mental Health Warning System

## 📖 Introduction
Mind Mesh is an AI-powered mental health analysis system designed to understand and interpret user statements. It uses Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify mental health conditions and provide meaningful support.

The system predicts the mental health category of user input, performs sentiment analysis, explains predictions, generates AI-based advice, and includes therapy features and a resources section for mental well-being.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
The goal of this project is to assist in the early identification of mental health conditions based on text input. It demonstrates how AI, Machine Learning, and NLP can be combined to build a helpful and user-friendly application.

---

## ⚙️ How the System Works
1. User enters a statement or selects mood  
2. ML model predicts mental health category (Depression, Stress, Anxiety, Normal)  
3. Sentiment analysis determines emotional tone  
4. Rule-based correction improves prediction accuracy  
5. AI generates personalized advice using Groq API  
6. Therapy exercises and resources are suggested
